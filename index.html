	<h3 align="center"><b>8 Good Money Habits to Adopt This Year</b></h3>

	<p align="right">Retirement planning should be one of the most important aspects an individual considers when they start their financial journey.

However, all too often common excuses stop people from putting money in the retirement pot – everything from believing they don’t earn enough money to save, that even if they did save it wouldn’t add up to much, or simply that they don’t know how to save.

A new report has highlighted the extent of this problem, with most savers set to miss their retirement goals by at least 50 per cent.

Standard Chartered, in its inaugural “Wealth Expectancy Report 2019,” found that a whopping 56 per cent of people in 10 of the world’s fastest-growing economies have retirement goals around twice the size of their likely pension pots at age 60.

The “wealth expectancy gap” was found to be pervasive across the 10 fast-growing economies such as China, Hong Kong, India, Kenya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the UAE.

In UAE, the report highlighted the tendency among respondents to focus on near-term financial goals. Although people in the Emirates regard financial security as critical to quality of life and happiness, they tend to focus on living in the here and now. Individuals in the affluent group, in particular, prefer to live in the moment (51 per cent) rather than worry about their financial future.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. Here are eight game-changing habits experts recommend for getting your retirement savings in place.</p>

	<p align="left">Manchester United moved onto the shoulder of fourth-placed Chelsea on Sunday after brushing aside lowly Watford as Wolves and Arsenal also staked their claims for Champions League football next season.
With runaway leaders Liverpool looking certain to win the Premier League, attention has switched to the race for European places, with just 10 points separating Chelsea from Southampton, in 12th spot.
New signing Bruno Fernandes opened his goalscoring account for United at Old Trafford from the penalty spot before impressive second-half goals from Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood sealed a 3-0 win.
It means United, who have struggled to find consistency all season, are now in fifth place on 41 points, just three adrift of Chelsea.</p>

	<h3 align="justify">Samsung admits to leaking personal data of almost 150 users</h3>
	<p>Seoul: South Korean tech giant Samsung has admitted that personal data of at least 150 users were leaked following "Find My Mobile" notifications error.

Thousands of premium Galaxy line up owners received a strange notification from the firm's "Find My Mobile" app last week.

The South Korean tech giant has admitted that another glitch occurred at almost the same time, resulting in a "small number" of users that were able to briefly access information from other Samsung users, including names, addresses and the last four digits of their payment cards, Tech Radar reported on Tuesday quoting Sam Mobile.

Late last week, many users posted on Reddit and Twitter getting a mysterious push notification on their Samsung devices that simply read "1/1".

The smartphone maker claims that the two issues were unrelated and that it was purely a coincidence that they occurred at around the same time. Samsung further clarified that 
the unintentional leak was the result of a technical error on the company's UK website, and only affected 150 customers, the report added.</p>
